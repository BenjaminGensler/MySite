                            Hi! I'm Ben, and i'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow. I'm a software developer with a passion for learning new technologies and creating new things. If you don't see me working on something i'm enjoy life with my family and friends. 
                            <br \> <br \>
                            If you want to know more about me or my work, feel free to look around this site. Enjoy!

            <h2>
                Projects
            </h2>
            <p>
                Throughout my days I'm always finding new projects to work on whether that be something small like a arduino automatic motion camera or an entire app to help solve some problems I wish there were easy solutions for. 
                <br \> <br \>
                So why not make these myself and grow my skills in the process? I'm always looking for new projects to work on and new technologies to learn.

            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy a variety of hobbies such as hiking, reading, crocheting, photography, games, carving, and many many more.
                <br \> <br \>
                Why do I enjoy learning so many hobbies? Why wouldn't I? It's always enjoy able to learn something new and to be able to create something original with my own hands.
